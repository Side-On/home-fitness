# Testing 

## User stories

Below I've gone through the journey of a potential customer. Each part meeting a users expectations and going through their user story. I've followed the spreadsheet whilst testing that each works as expected, any issues with the process has been documented along with the fixes. The testing was done on desktop, and the mobile screen testing was focused on the layout, as apposed to the functionality aspect. This is detailed in the CSS section of the testing.

They can all choose all products, and they choose from price, rating or just all products.

If the user selects all products and chooses a way to sort by, they are taken to this page. This lists all products which are available on the site. Each page is different depending on what catergory they chose. So if the user selects weights, they'll be shown all items which are in the weights category.

## HTML 

Working through the user stories I explored each link to reach the expected outcome. This was completed several times throughout the production of the project so I was constantly testing and resolving any issues with it.

### Code validation

Each HTML page was passed through [w3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Below are some of the errors encountered. I've ignored the errors which are connecting to Django, for example: `{% extends "base.html" %}`

One error showing on the checkout.html page:

```
Empty heading.

From line 136, column 3; to line 136, column 51

<h1 class="text-light logo-font loading-spinner">â†©    <
```
This is required for the overlay to show the loading spinner what a payment is being processed.
