# Wireframes and Design

I wanted to keep the website design simple and easy to navigate for the user. I wanted the website to be obvious from the first page as to what it was about. To do this I have a simple navbar at the top of the page, found on each page of the website to keep consitency througout.

For the mobile view, I added a dropdown menu so that the links are easily visible on all screen sizes.
