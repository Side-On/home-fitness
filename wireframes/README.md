# Wireframes and Design

I wanted to keep the website design simple and easy to navigate for the user. I wanted the website to be obvious from the first page as to what it was about. To do this I have a simple navbar at the top of the page, found on each page of the website to keep consitency througout.

For the mobile view, I added a dropdown menu so that the links are easily visible on all screen sizes.

## Index page

This is the first page the user sees. The navbar is clear at the top to be the first thing visible. It's shows all of the available categories of items to shop by. There's also a search bar for users to find a product they're looking for.
<br>
The index page also shows a unique hero image which displays a large gym setting. This also gives the user an idea of what the website is about. 
<br>
There's also an explanation as to who Home Fitness are, and what they have to offer. This text encourages users to scroll down the page and find out more.
<br>
At the end of that are images of categories to take the users straight to that page

## Category Page

Depedending of what link the user's clicked on, it will take them to the various product categories. Each category shows a different hero image, relevant to the category. It also displays different text to match the category.
<br>
The user is then shown each of the category items the site has for sale. The item has a price and name for what it is. It also shows an image of the item so the user knows what to expect.
<br>
Each item is a link to take the user to the item description page.

## Product Detail Page

This is where the user is told more information about the product they've selected. It has a description of it, the brand, the rating. It also shows if any other user has left a review about it.
<br>
If the user is logged in, they are shown a button which lets them leave a review. If they aren't logged in, then they are shown two links to either login, or register for an account.

## Shopping Bag Page

This shows all of the items that have been added to the users basket while they've been shopping. It give a full view of each, how many of one item have been selected, and a grand total for everything.
<br>
Here users can add more of an item or remove it completely.

## Checkout Page

![Checkout Page](/wireframes/screenshots/checkout-wireframe.png)

This page is where the user is requested to enter all of their delivery information, as well as their payment details to go through with the transaction.
<br>
Some of the fields are mandatory, so that no vital information is missed when recording the order on the database. It's also to stop any wrong information being added by the user and therefore getting the order wrong.

## Fit Tips Page

![Fit TIps Page](/wireframes/screenshots/fit-tips-wireframe.png)

Users are able to share their experiences with each of the products the site sells.
<br>
They need to be logged in to leave a fit tip. When they are logged in, other fields are visible which enable them to choose what item they want to leave a fit tip about.
<br>
The fields are mandatory to stop users from accidentally leaving a fit tip without any actual content. It is also set up to show the latest fit tip at the top of the page

## Login Page

![Login Page](/wireframes/screenshots/login-wireframe.png)

If users already have an account with Home Fitness, they can log into it from this page. It's a basic page asking for just their email/username. 
<br>
If they've forgotten their password, they can request to reset it. Home Fitness sends an email with a link to do this.

## Register Page

![Register Page](/wireframes/screenshots/register-wireframe.png)

New users can go to this page to get an account. They are required to enter an email, password and username to do this.
<br>
They will then receive an email to confirm that they want to create an account. Once this has been done, they are able to leave reviews and fit tips.


## Account Page

![Account Page](/wireframes/screenshots/account-wireframe.png)

This page has the user's saved delivery information from their last order. They are able to update this data, if they move address.
<br>
The users order history is also shown, which is useful for any user who wants to know information about how much they spent on their last order, or need to check when it was made.


# Colour design

I wanted to keep the colour design quite dark, as I felt this is quite a common theme amoung some of the other gym style websites. A lot of gym equipment is dark as well so I felt it was that best way to go forward. The red logo stands out against the black as well.
<br>
I wanted to have the text white to be clear against the darker backgrounds. But then switched this on and product information card, review or fit tip as I felt it stood out the best against the darker background.
