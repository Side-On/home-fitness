# Milestone 4 Project
## Home Fitness
<br>

### Site Owner Goals

>I want to create a website where people can buy the latest fitness equipment. I'm a small start up so I don't have the largest array of products, but I hope to increase this by bringing people to buy my products. 
Users with accounts should be rewarded and given things which non-registered users don't have access to, such as leaving reviews or rating for the items they buy. I'm hoping this will encourage returning customers and make it easier for them to put my products as well by saving their details. I also want registered users to be able to have more than one delivery address to make it easier to switch between addresses.
